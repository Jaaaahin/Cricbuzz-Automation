🚀 Just Automated My First Real-World Task with Selenium! 🏏💻
Thrilled to share that I’ve successfully automated Cricbuzz.com using Selenium! This project taught me how to interact with dynamic web elements and structure a real-world automation flow.
What I built:
✅ Automated navigation: Script clicks through tabs (e.g., News, Live Scores) and displays news articles.
✅ Dynamic content handling: Extracted/displayed article headlines or summaries from dynamically loaded sections.
✅ Graceful exit: Ensured the browser closes cleanly after execution.
Challenges I tackled:
🔹 Timing issues with explicit waits (waiting for tabs/content to load).
🔹 Crafting reliable XPath/CSS locators for dynamic elements (thanks, Cricbuzz for the practice! 😅).
🔹 Avoiding false positives by validating visible content.
Key takeaways:
✨ Importance of WebDriver methods (e.g., click(), getText()) for browser interactions.
✨ How to structure scripts for readability and reusability.
✨ Debugging is 50% of automation – learned to love the DevTools console!
Shoutout to [mention mentors/resources if any] for the guidance.
To my network: What’s your #1 tip for improving Selenium scripts? 🙌 Should I explore Page Object Model next, or integrate TestNG/JUnit for better test management? Let me know!
