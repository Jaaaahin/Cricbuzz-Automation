# 🚀 Cricbuzz.com Automation with Selenium 🏏💻

Thrilled to share that I’ve successfully automated **Cricbuzz.com** using **Selenium WebDriver**!  
This project marks my first real-world web automation effort and taught me how to work with dynamic websites effectively.

## 🔧 What I Built

✅ **Automated Navigation**  
- Script clicks through key Cricbuzz tabs like **News**, **Live Scores**, and more.  
- Extracts and displays headlines or summaries from dynamically loaded sections.

✅ **Dynamic Content Handling**  
- Uses explicit waits and smart locators to interact with elements that load asynchronously.

✅ **Graceful Exit**  
- Ensures the browser session is properly closed at the end of execution.

## 🧗‍♂️ Challenges I Tackled

🔹 **Timing Issues**  
- Resolved issues using `WebDriverWait` and Selenium’s explicit wait features.

🔹 **Unstable Locators**  
- Practiced writing reliable XPath and CSS selectors to handle dynamic elements.

🔹 **False Positives**  
- Added validation checks to confirm only visible and loaded content is logged.

## 💡 Key Learnings

✨ Learned to use essential **WebDriver methods** like `click()`, `getText()`, and `findElement()` for real interactions.  
✨ Improved script **structure** and code **reusability** for easier maintenance.  
✨ Embraced **DevTools Console** for debugging locator paths and DOM inspection.
